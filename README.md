# just-a-big-textarea

This is a tiny, single-page utility that does exactly what it says: it gives you a big `<textarea>` in the center of the screen.

## 🔍 What’s it for?

Ever landed on a website where you can *select* and *drag* text—but Ctrl+C doesn’t copy it? This tool is for you.

Just drag the selected text onto the textarea. Then hit **Copy** to grab it to your clipboard, or **Clear** to reset.

## 📦 Features

* Clean, classless styling with [Sakura.css](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) 
* Big central `<textarea>`
* Two simple buttons: **Copy** and **Clear**
* Works offline once loaded
